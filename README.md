# Ex Development - Panic Button

This is a panic button for the Police Department. 

This panic button can be triggered via the command "/panic". But not only that. It can also be used via a panic button item. 

As soon as a panic button is triggered, all employees of the Police Department receive a message that an employee is asking for help. This can be confirmed via the "E" button or rejected via "G".
